<section class="c-story-body has-l-btm-marg t-size-b story_body">
  <p>Our editor outputs blocks of texts with paragraph tags. This parent class also accounts for descendant links, headings, horizontal rules, and lists.</p>
  <h3>Horizontal Rules</h3>
  <p>Use a horizontal rule to break up content. A horizontal rule is displayed below.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p>The hr tag has built in top and bottom margin. We do this because it's normally used as a spacing element and the need for cushion is assumed.</p>
  <h3>Ordered Lists</h3>
  <p>Ordered lists are lists with numbers and need the special container and a list style treatment.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>This is the first item.</li>
    <li>This is the second item.</li>
    <li>This is the third item.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Unordered Lists</h3>
  <p>Unordered lists are lists with bullets and also need the special container and a list style treatment. We globally remove bullets so lists within the c-story-body class we add them back via the ul tag.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>This is the first item.</li>
    <li>This is the second item.</li>
    <li>This is the third item.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Headings</h3>
  <p>Our editor has a dropdown option called <em>Subheader</em> for adding a heading element. By default, that tag is an h3. In the event someone were to open the source and add others, this is how they would display.</p>
  <h2>Heading 2</h2>
  <h3>Heading 3 - Default</h3>
  <h4>Heading 4</h4>
  <h5>Heading 5</h5>
  <h6>Heading 6</h6>
  <h3>Plugins</h3>
  <p>Plugins are special and have their own rules for positioning. A div without the plugin class will still align with the story text, but any div prefixed with "plugin" will be excluded from the max-width and margin declaration the other elements adhere to.</p>
  <div class="plugin has-padding has-bg-gray-light">Example of plugin. Should be not be bound by container.</div>
  <div class="plugin-ad has-padding has-bg-gray-light">Example of ad plugin. Should be not be bound by container</div>
